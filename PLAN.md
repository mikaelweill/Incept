     - Article/Question <-> Standard mapping JSON created ✓
   - Implement basic subject/grade tagging
   - Add NGSS standard matching
   - Implement lesson-level tagging
   - Success Criteria: Works for sample questions

## Phase 1.5: Visualization UI
1. Simple Dashboard
   - Create a basic web interface to visualize mapping relationships
   - Enable browsing of standards, lessons, and sample questions
   - Success Criteria: Can visually navigate the curriculum structure

2. Relationship Visualization
   - Implement a graph or tree view of standard-lesson relationships
   - Create interactive elements to explore connections
   - Success Criteria: Relationships are intuitively displayed

3. Content Preview
   - Add ability to preview sample questions
   - Show metadata and tagging information
   - Success Criteria: Content is viewable in context

## Phase 2: Quality Control System (UPDATED)
1. Question Grading Framework
   - Define basic grading criteria
   - Create simple scoring system
   - Leverage existing lesson/standard mappings for context-aware grading
   - Success Criteria: Can grade sample questions

2. LLM Integration
   - Set up OpenAI client
   - Basic prompt engineering
   - Include standard/lesson context from mapping JSONs in prompts
   - Success Criteria: Can get reliable responses

3. Quality Control Pipeline
   - Implement grading pipeline
   - Add feedback generation
   - Use mapping metadata to evaluate alignment with curriculum
   - Success Criteria: Can identify good/bad questions

## Phase 3: Question Generation (UPDATED)
1. Basic Generation
   - Template-based generation
   - Basic validation
   - Use standard/lesson mappings to target specific content areas
   - Success Criteria: Can generate valid questions

2. Quality-Aware Generation
   - Integrate with QC pipeline
   - Use sample questions from mapping files as examples/templates
   - Success Criteria: Generated questions pass QC

## Phase 4: Article System (UPDATED)
1. Article Generation
   - Generate content from questions
   - Add worked examples
   - Ensure consistency with standard descriptions from mapping files
   - Success Criteria: Articles match questions and standards

## Phase 5: Refinement & Scaling
1. Performance Improvements
   - Basic caching of JSON mappings for fast lookups
   - Optimize LLM usage with contextual information from mappings
   - Success Criteria: Reasonable response times

2. Error Handling
   - Add core error handling
   - Basic retry logic
   - Validation against mapping files to catch content misalignments
   - Success Criteria: System handles common errors

## Success Metrics
1. Question Quality
   - Questions are grade-appropriate
   - Questions align with standards (verified against standard<->lesson mapping)
   - Clear and unambiguous

2. Article Quality
   - Covers question concepts
   - Grade-appropriate explanations
   - Clear worked examples
   - Consistent with curriculum structure defined in mapping files

3. System Performance
   - Reasonable response times
   - Reliable operation
   - UI responsiveness for visualization components

## Current Progress
- ✓ Created Standard <-> Lesson mapping JSON
- ✓ Created Article/Question <-> Standard mapping JSON
- These mapping files provide the foundation for question tagging and subsequent phases
- The curriculum structure is now well-defined and ready to be used for implementation
- Next steps: Create visualization UI to better conceptualize the data relationships
